# Introduction

- Nowadays, everyone is talking about open source and cross-platform development.
- Microsoft has always been known for its Windows-based products, but now we are in a new age of development.
- For this, a new revolutionary product has come into the market, which is Microsoft .NET Core.
- .NET Core is a free open-source and cross-platform framework, created for building modern cloud-based applications, and every .NET developer feels proud of it.
- Now, there are no boundaries for the platform. Every .NET developer can say, "Yes, I am platform-independent; I am using open source."
- In the revolution of software development, Microsoft launched its first .NET framework in the year 2000 with its first version, .NET Framework 1.0.

# Open Source Means

- The software being distributed must be redistributed to anyone else without any restrictions.
- The source code must be made available so that the receiving party will be able to improve or modify it.
