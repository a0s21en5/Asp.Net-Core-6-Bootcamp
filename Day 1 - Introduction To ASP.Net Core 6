# Introduction

- Nowadays, everyone is talking about open-source and cross-platform development.
- Microsoft has always been known for its Windows-based products, but now we are in a new age of development.
- For this, a new revolutionary product has come into the market, which is Microsoft .NET Core.
- .NET Core is a free open-source and cross-platform framework, created for building modern cloud-based applications, and every .NET developer feels proud of it.
- Now, there are no boundaries for the platform. Every .NET developer can say, "Yes, I am platform-independent; I am using open source."
- In the revolution of software development, Microsoft launched its first .NET framework in the year 2000 with its first version, .NET Framework 1.0.
- This framework plays a major role in the field of software development. People love Microsoft technology products because these products are easy to use and learn.
- In the year 2006, Microsoft came up with a new revolution, Microsoft .NET Core 1.0. People always love ASP.NET because it works over the World Wide Web.
- ASP.NET Core is a new open-source, cross-platform framework to create modern web-based cloud-based systems, which means now you are not only working for Windows; you can run on Linux, Mac, i.e., wherever you want.

# Open Source Means

- In general, open source refers to any program whose source code is made available for use or modification as users or other developers see fit. Open-source software is usually developed as a public collaboration and made freely available.
- The software being distributed must be redistributed to anyone else without any restrictions.
- The source code must be made available so that the receiving party can improve or modify it.

# ASP.NET Core Features

- Cross-platform and open source: ASP.NET Core now runs your app over Linux, Windows, and Mac, i.e., wherever you want.
- Fast Development: Enables fast work over the browsers.
- Editor choice: You can work not only in Visual Studio but also in Visual Studio Code.
- Based on Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.


# What is ASP.NET Core?

- ASP.NET Core is a new version of ASP.NET, developed by Microsoft.
- It is an open-source framework for developing web applications that can be run on Windows, Mac, or Linux.
- It has been completely rewritten from scratch and was initially launched as ASP.NET 5 but then was renamed to ASP.NET Core 1.0.
- ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications.
- It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, allowing you to retain flexibility while constructing your solutions.


# Introduction

- Before ASP.NET Core, Microsoft already had two other similar frameworks, known as ASP.NET Web Forms (popularly known as just ASP.NET) and ASP.NET MVC.
- The latest version of ASP.NET Core is ASP.NET Core 7.0, which was released on February 24, 2023.
- From .NET 5.0, the word "Core" is dropped from its name.
- So, all frameworks from now on will be named as .NET 6, .NET 7, .NET 8, and so on.
